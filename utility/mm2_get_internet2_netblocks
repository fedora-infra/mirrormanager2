# get internet2 netblocks
#
# This file is part of MirrorManager2.
#
# The purpose of this script is to download a BGP table of netblocks
# and then write out a file matching those netblocks to ASNs (autonomous system
# numbers).  ASNs are administrative numbers designated by IAANA which define a
# kind of boundary for a set of routers.  For instance, MIT's ASN is 3; every
# router within MIT's sphere of influence bears that ASN.  Every ISP has their
# own, etc.
#
# This script produces one of two netblocks files (along with its sister,
# get_global_netblocks) which gets read in by the mirrorlist-server daemon and
# used as part of the larger mirror-matching logic there.  When people query
# the mirrorlist, we can match their IP (potentially) to an ASN to get them to
# a mirror that's closer to them than not.
