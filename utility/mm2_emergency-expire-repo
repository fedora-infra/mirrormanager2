This script is an emergency script meant for releng to be used if an very
important update has went out, and we want to make sure that clients pick up
the latest version of the repo, even if that means more load on the master
mirrors.
It does this by deleting all non-current file_detail entries for this specific
repository, resulting in no alternate file checksums in the pickle.
This will cause the metalink to not return any <alternates> entries, such that
only the very latest version of the repo is considered as up-to-date.
