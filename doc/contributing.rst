============

If you're submitting patches to MirrorManager2, please observe the following:

- Check that your python code is `PEP8-compliant
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.  There is a `pep8 tool
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_ that can automatically check
  your source.

- If your change warrants a modification to the docs in ``doc/`` or any
  docstrings in ``MirrorManager2/`` please make that modification.

.. note:: You have a doubt, you don't know how to do something, you have an
   idea but don't know how to implement it, you just have something bugging
   you?

   Come to see us on IRC: ``#fedora-apps`` on irc.freenode.net
