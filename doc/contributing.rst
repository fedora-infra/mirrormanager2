============

If you're submitting patches to MirrorManager2, please observe the following:

- Check that your python code is `PEP8-compliant
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.  There is a `pep8 tool
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_ that can automatically check
  your source.

- If your change warrants a modification to the docs in ``doc/`` or any
  docstrings in ``MirrorManager2/`` please make that modification.

.. note:: You have a doubt, you don't know how to do something, you have an
   idea but don't know how to implement it, you just have something bugging
   you?

   Come to see us on Matrix in the `Fedora Apps <https://matrix.to/#/#apps:fedoraproject.org>`_. room.
